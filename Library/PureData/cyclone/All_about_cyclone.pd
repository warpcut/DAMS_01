#X text 68 351 Most of cyclone objects are single binaries \, so all
you need is to have tem inside the cyclone folder amongst your other
external libraries (preferably in the Pd standard path)., f 72;
#X text 69 398 You can then include this folder in Pd's "Path" \, but
there's also a "cyclone sub-library" that includes a subset of 12 non-alphanumeric
objects. To install it you need to include "cyclone" in Pd's Startup.

#X text 63 191 - Cyclone's development starts in 2002 (at the time
of Max 4.0) and never reached full compliance to the latest Max 4 release
(4.6.3 from 2007). Cyclone 0.3 updates the library by including missing
functionalities from Max 4 and further updates (from Max 5 to Max 7).
, f 73;
#X text 63 253 - New objects were also included and several bug fixes
were made \; check details in the changelog at: https://github.com/porres/pd-cyclone/wiki/cyclone-0.3-changlelog
